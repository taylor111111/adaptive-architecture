# 🎏 **The Song of the Koinobori: From Soldiers' Pain to Developers' Struggles — What Is the Cost of an Ideal?**

> **The koinobori (carp streamer) soars in the wind. But is it truly free?**

## **1. The Banner of Ideals — Who Keeps It Flying?**

👤 **Q: What was the Emperor’s ideal?**  
📌 **A: To build a powerful empire, sending soldiers into battle to achieve wartime glory.**

👤 **Q: What is the architect’s ideal?**  
📌 **A: To design the perfect system, allowing developers to work efficiently and realize a technological vision.**

🎏 **Similarities:**
- The ones setting ambitious goals are usually not the ones on the battlefield.
- They firmly believe their vision is the “right direction,” but the burden of execution falls on others.
- In reality, achieving these ideals often requires **great sacrifice and struggle** from those below.

**So, the question is—who ultimately pays the price for the architect’s vision?**

## **2. Soldiers’ Pain vs. Developers’ Struggles**

👤 **Q: What do soldiers experience in war?**  
📌 **A: They charge forward, face deadly traps, and suffer injuries—or worse. But do they truly understand what they are fighting for?**

👤 **Q: What do developers experience in the workplace?**  
📌 **A: They work late fixing bugs, refactoring code, pulling all-nighters—only to see the architecture discarded, forcing them to start over.**

🎏 **Similarities:**
- Both are **frontline warriors**, carrying out decisions made from above.
- Their **efforts and sacrifices** often go unnoticed or unrecognized.
- In their struggle, some persevere and “sacrifice without regret,” while others slowly become numb.

**The key difference? A developer can quit their job. A soldier cannot.**

## **3. The Little Carp Trusts the Big Carp vs. Developers Trusting Architects**

👤 **Q: Why does the little carp follow the big carp?**  
📌 **A: The young fish believes the big carp will guide them to broader waters, even if it means facing rough currents.**

👤 **Q: Why do developers follow architects?**  
📌 **A: They trust that architects will design better systems, optimizing workflows and making development easier.**

🎏 **Reality check:**
- Eventually, the little carp might realize that **not every big carp knows the way forward**.
- Likewise, developers may come to understand that **not every architect’s decisions are worth following**.

**When you realize the path ahead is flawed, do you continue following—or choose to change direction?**

## **4. The Big Carp Facing the Rapids vs. Architects’ Dedication and Developers’ Execution**

👤 **Q: What roles do the little and big carp play?**  
📌 **A: The big carp seeks direction, while the little carp follows and faces challenges alongside it.**

👤 **Q: What about architects and developers?**  
📌 **A: Architects analyze and devise optimal solutions, while developers execute with precision.**

🎏 **But reality often looks like this:**
- **Architects over-design**, leading developers into endless refactors and unnecessary complexity.
- **Developers execute flawlessly**, but on an architecture that **doesn’t truly fit business needs**.

**When execution and leadership become misaligned, who takes responsibility?**

## **5. “Chew, Chew” Song vs. Developers’ Time Poverty**

👤 **Q: Where does the “Chew, Chew” song in *Totto-chan: The Little Girl at the Window* come from?**  
📌 **A: Originally, it was a song encouraging children to eat well and grow strong. But during wartime food shortages, the phrase ‘chew, chew’ became ironic—children tried to eat, but there was no food.**

👤 **Q: Why do developers feel like they never have enough time?**  
📌 **A: They want to learn new technologies and grow, but endless meetings, urgent bug fixes, and overtime drain all their time and energy.**

🎏 **Similarities:**
- Both know that **growth is important**, yet reality **robs them of their opportunities to grow**.
- Both are “chewing and chewing,” but the nourishment (time to develop skills) keeps shrinking.

**Is your time being invested in growth, or just drained by endless repetitive tasks?**

## **6. How Should Architects Respond to the “Chew, Chew” Song?**

👤 **Q: Do architects recognize the issue of developers’ time poverty?**  
📌 **A: Architects focus on system-wide optimizations but may overlook execution cost—trapping developers in a cycle of endless overwork and shifting requirements.**

👤 **Q: How can architects adjust their strategies to reduce developer burnout?**  
📌 **A: By avoiding overengineering, managing requirements better, and increasing automation, architects can help developers focus on actual value creation rather than meaningless ‘chewing.’**

🎏 **Optimization Strategies:**
- **Reduce unnecessary architectural complexity** to prevent endless refactoring.
- **Improve requirement management** to minimize scope creep and rework.
- **Ensure room for professional growth** so developers gain skills, rather than just “putting out fires.”

**An architect’s ideal should not be built on endless developer overtime.**

## **💡 Final Thoughts: Are You a Soaring Banner or a Fish Caught in the Current?**

Architects, developers, soldiers, and carp—each is searching for direction.

🎏 **Do you want to be a banner blown by the wind, or determine your own path?**

If you are an architect, how would you change your approach?

If you are a developer, have you experienced your own “chew, chew” moment?
